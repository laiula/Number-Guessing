# Number-Guessing
This repository contains a Java program for a number guessing game. The program prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 within a limited number of attempts. If the user's guess is smaller than the target number, the program provides a feedback message indicating the need to choose a greater number, and vice versa.
